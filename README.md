This is the project repository for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program's Project No. 2 Behavioral Cloning of Term 2 Sensor Fusion by Albert Killer. 

An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was implemented in C++ to process simulated lidar and radar measurements provided by Udacity. In doing so the position and velocity of an object, which is moving around the vehicle equiped with those sensors, is detected with high accuracy:

```
Accuracy - RMSE:
0.0972256
0.0853761
0.4508550
0.4395880
